# Horizon Hapi Example

Example of a barebones, but working app with hapi and horizon.io...I couldn't find one that worked, even the examples, so I made one of my own!

All you do is `npm install` and `npm start`.

Of course, you need to make sure you have [rethinkdb](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/) (surprisingly easy) installed already too.
